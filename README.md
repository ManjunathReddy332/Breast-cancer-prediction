# Breast-cancer-prediction

This project focuses on developing a neural network model to predict whether a breast tumor is benign or malignant using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset. The dataset includes various diagnostic features, such as the mean radius, texture, perimeter, and smoothness of the cell nuclei from digitized images of breast tissue. The model uses these features as input to predict the binary target variable, benign tumor or malignant tumor.

A simple neural network was implemented for this task. And the model is evaluated using accuracy metrics to ensure reliable prediction performance. The use of a neural network provides a powerful approach to early breast cancer detection, offering potential benefits in clinical decision-making and improving patient outcomes.
